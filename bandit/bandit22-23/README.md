# Bandit Level 22 â†’ Level 23

## Level Goal

A program is running automatically at regular intervals from **cron**, the time-based job scheduler. Look in **/etc/cron.d/** for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

**NOTE:** Looking at shell scripts written by other people is a very useful skill. The script for this level is intentionally made easy to read. If you are having problems understanding what it does, try executing it to see the debug information it prints.

## Walkthrough

Login to the server using the password obtained from the previous level [Bandit level 21 -> 22](../bandit21-22/README.md). 

username: `bandit22` 

```
ssh bandit22@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

Like the previous level we are looking for a job in the `/etc/cron.d` directory.

```
bandit22@bandit:~$ cd /etc/cron.d
bandit22@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ ls -l
total 24
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  62 May 14  2020 cronjob_bandit15_root
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  62 Jul 11  2020 cronjob_bandit17_root
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 120 May  7  2020 cronjob_bandit22
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 122 May  7  2020 cronjob_bandit23
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 120 May 14  2020 cronjob_bandit24
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  62 May 14  2020 cronjob_bandit25_root
```

Last time we used `cronjob_bandit22` so this time we use `cronjob_bandit23`.


```
bandit22@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ cat cronjob_bandit23
@reboot bandit23 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh &> /dev/null
* * * * * bandit23 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh &> /dev/null

bandit22@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ 
```

It looks like `/usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh` is running each minute and with user `bandit23's` permissions.

We go to `/usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh` and read what it is doing.

```bash
/usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh

#!/bin/bash

myname=$(whoami)
mytarget=$(echo I am user $myname | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)

echo "Copying passwordfile /etc/bandit_pass/$myname to /tmp/$mytarget"

cat /etc/bandit_pass/$myname > /tmp/$mytarget
```

The bash script is running the **whoami** command and storing it in the `myname` variable. 

It is then creating a hash of the text "I am user $myname", then using the **cut** command it is extracting a piece of the output and saving it in the `mytarget` variable.

Finally the script is copying a password into a new file in the /tmp directory. The new file will use the value stored in `mytarget` as its name.

If we run the script now `myname` will contain `bandit22`. It will then create a hash and copy the password stored in `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit22` to a file in `/tmp` using the hash as its name.

```
bandit22@bandit:~$ /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh
Copying passwordfile /etc/bandit_pass/bandit22 to /tmp/8169b67bd894ddbb4412f91573b38db3

bandit22@bandit:~$ cat /tmp/8169b67bd894ddbb4412f91573b38db3

`Bandit22's` password is something we already know. When the cronjob runs the bash script it is doing so as user `bandit23`, so whoami would return `bandit23` and the script would then save `bandit23's` password in a file in /tmp.

We can find out what the file name is by running this line of the bash script.

```bash
echo I am user $myname | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)
```

When we replace $myname with bandit23 we get the name of the file in /tmp containing the password.

```
bandit22@bandit:~$ echo I am user bandit23 | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1
