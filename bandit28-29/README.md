# Bandit Level 28 â†’ Level 29

## Level Goal

There is a git repository at `ssh://bandit28-git@localhost/home/bandit28-git/repo`. The password for the user `bandit28-git` is the same as for the user `bandit28`.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.

---

## Walkthrough

Login to the server using the password obtained from the previous level [Bandit level 27 -> 28](../bandit27-28/README.md). 

username: `bandit28` 

```ssh
ssh bandit28@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```


For this challenge we need to clone a git repository and search the repo for the password.  
First thing is to create a working directory to clone the repository into and then clone the repo.

```console
bandit28@bandit:~$ mkdir /tmp/bandit28
bandit28@bandit:~$ cd /tmp/bandit28

bandit28@bandit:/tmp/bandit28$ git clone ssh://bandit28-git@localhost/home/bandit28-git/repo
Cloning into 'repo'...

bandit28-git@localhost's password:
remote: Counting objects: 9, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (6/6), done.
remote: Total 9 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
Receiving objects: 100% (9/9), done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (2/2), done.

bandit28@bandit:/tmp/bandit28$
```

Now that the repo has been cloned we can change into the repo directory and start inspecting.  
Using `git log` we can check the history of the repo.


```console
bandit28@bandit:/tmp/bandit28$ ls
repo

bandit28@bandit:/tmp/bandit28$ cd repo/
bandit28@bandit:/tmp/bandit28/repo$ git log

    initial commit of README.md

bandit28@bandit:/tmp/bandit28/repo$
```

Git log shows 3 commits in the history.
- fix info leak
- add missing data
- initial commit of README.md


Currently the `README` file does not contain the password.

```
bandit28@bandit:/tmp/bandit28/repo$ cat README.md

## credentials

- username: bandit29
- password: xxxxxxxxxx

bandit28@bandit:/tmp/bandit28/repo$
```

By reading the commit descriptions we can assume the password was removed in the `fix info leak` commit. We need to see what was in the file in the other commits.


Using `git diff <commit id>` we can see what changes were made between the current commit and the commit id we enter.

We can use the commit id of the `add missing data` commit to see what was in the README before the info leak was fixed.

```console
bandit28@bandit:/tmp/bandit28/repo$ git diff c086d11
diff --git a/README.md b/README.md
index 3f7cee8..5c6457b 100644

 ## credentials

 - username: bandit29

+- password: xxxxxxxxxx

bandit28@bandit:/tmp/bandit28/repo$
```

Having used `git diff` we can see that the password was removed from the README but we can still read it from the output of the diff.

## Alternate

An alternate method to solve this challenge is to use `git checkout <commit id>` to bring the repository back to a previous state and then read the README file.

```console
bandit28@bandit:/tmp/bandit28/repo$ git checkout c086d11
Note: checking out 'c086d11'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

HEAD is now at c086d11... add missing data

bandit28@bandit:/tmp/bandit28/repo$ cat README.md
